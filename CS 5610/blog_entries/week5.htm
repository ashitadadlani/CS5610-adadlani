    <h3>AngularJS</h3>
    <p>
        In this week, I have tried basic functionalities in AngularJS.The experiments use bootsrap as well. <br />
        I have tried the following:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Filters: </b>I have created a form and used uppercase and currency filters, and pipe(|) character</li>
            <li><b>Tables: </b>In this, I have created a table with pre-defined data and used ng-repeat directive to search in the table</li>
            <li><b>Adding/Removing from table: </b>Here I have tried dynamically adding and removing from the table with 
            pre-existing data.</li>
            <li><b>Validations: </b>In this experiment, I have tried validating several input fields of a form</li>
            <li><b>Event Handling: </b>Here, I used event handlers for DOM elements</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
