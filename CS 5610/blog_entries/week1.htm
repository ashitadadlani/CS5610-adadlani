    <h2>Ashita's blog</h2>
    <p>During this week, created my homepage using CSS and I implemented various functionalities using HTML 5. For example, creating forms using form tags 
    and it's attributes to get text imputs, passwords, radio buttons, checkboxes and datalists. Using HTML 5 media tags I tried 
    embedding YouTube videos, explored iframe tag and used script tag for drag and drop functionality. For CSS, I created external 
    stylesheet and linked it to all the experiments. Further, I plan to keep working on new features.</p>
