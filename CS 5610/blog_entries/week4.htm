    <h3>jQuery</h3>
    <p>This week I experimented on jQuery. I learned how does local storage works and how can we retreive the 
    created enteries. I explored various widgets like accordion, autocomplete and menu. I looked on various types of
    interctions such as drag and drop, how to resize and how to sort a list. I experienced some new effects such as
    fade in/fade out, show or hiding something, animation effects. At last, I did some miscellaneous experiments 
    such as toggling a slide, focusing and adding a tooltip on an input field, addind images/text on mouseup()/mousedown() events.</p>
